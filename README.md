# Road Damage Detection Dataset for Convolutional Neural Network Object Detection - Indonesia

Welcome to our repository housing a comprehensive dataset tailored for convolutional neural network (CNN) object detection tasks, focusing on road damage detection. Our dataset comprises over 9,000 labeled images sourced from various locations throughout Indonesia, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of computer vision and infrastructure management.

# Key Features

1. **Crowdsourced Labeling**: Each image in our dataset has been painstakingly labeled by a team of 46 dedicated contributors. Their collaborative efforts ensured accurate annotations for training reliable CNN models.
2. **Diverse Road Damage Types**: Our dataset encompasses five distinct types of road damage: longitudinal crack, lateral crack, alligator crack, pothole, and other road damage. This diversity enables the development of models capable of detecting and classifying various forms of road deterioration.
3. **Indonesian Context**: The images in our dataset originate from real-world roads across Indonesia, providing a contextualized dataset reflective of the unique challenges faced in the region's infrastructure management.
4. **Usable for Object Detection**: Designed specifically for CNN-based object detection tasks, our dataset facilitates the training and evaluation of models to identify and localize road damage instances accurately
5. **YOLO Label Format**: Due to the popularity of the YOLO algorithm for its state-of-the-art performance in several object detection cases in CNN, our dataset label format is available in YOLO format.
